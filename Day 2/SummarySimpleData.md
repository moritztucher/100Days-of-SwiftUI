## Summary: Simple Data

Constants: `let`
Variables: `var`

built-in arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` can be shortend to `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` if just variable itself should be changes. 
Example: `counter = counter + 1` => `counter += 1`

Booleans can be flipped with `.toogle()`

String interpolation works with `\(var/let)` but can only be a var if the string is also a var.
